# 🐙 How to Push Your Backend to GitHub

I have successfully initialized the Git repository for **Eaiser_Mobile_backend** and committed your code locally.

## 🚀 Next Steps (You need to do this)

1.  **Go to GitHub**: [Create a New Repository](https://github.com/new).
    *   Name it `Eaiser_Mobile_backend` (or whatever you like).
    *   **Do NOT** initialize with README, license, or gitignore (we already have them).

2.  **Connect Remote**:
    Copy the "HTTPS" URL of your new repository (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/Eaiser_Mobile_backend.git`).
    Run this command in your terminal (inside `Eaiser_Mobile_backend` folder):
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
    ```

3.  **Push Code**:
    Run this command to upload your code:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

## ✅ Done!
Your backend code will now be safe on GitHub.
*   **Note:** I have already configured `.gitignore` so your secret `.env` file (API keys) and `venv` folder will **NOT** be uploaded. This is for your security.
